        <p>TXOne Stellar offers two modes for agent management:</p>
        <ul id="ul_qbj_3mt_yvb">
            <li>
                <p>Agents installed in <b><i>Managed</i></b> mode are managed by a <ph
                        conkeyref="PRODvars/PRODUCT_SERVER_ALTERNATIVE_NAME"/> server, which can
                    issue remote commands to all managed agents. To deploy agent configuration
                    settings to multiple managed agents, launch the <ph
                        conkeyref="PRODvars/PRODUCT_SERVER_ALTERNATIVE_NAME"/> web console and use
                    the <b>Send Command</b> menu located on the <uicontrol>Agent</uicontrol>
                    management screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Agents installed in <i><b>Standalone</b></i> mode are not managed by a TXOne <ph
                        conkeyref="PRODvars/PRODUCT_SERVER_ALTERNATIVE_NAME"/> central management
                    console server; instead, they are managed by the local administrator or
                    operator. To manually deploy a single configuration to multiple standalone
                    agents, use an agent configuration file.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
