<refbody><section><draft-comment>This topic uses variables based
on the ../bp_legal_vars.xml file. Update that file to modify output.
Please do not change anything in this topic or rename the file.
It is boilerplate and should have a 100% match with L10n translation
memory. If you need to modify this topic, then it is no longer boilerplate
and the translation memory is compared product version to version
and not shared commonly across all products. If you change the file,
please rename it too. </draft-comment><p>This documentation introduces the main features of the product and/or provides installation
                instructions for a production environment. Read through the documentation before
                installing or using the product. </p><p>TXOne Networks always seeks to improve its documentation. If you have questions, comments, or
