<conbody><p>From time to time, TXOne may release a patch for a reported known issue or an upgrade that
                                    applies to a specific product or service. To find out whether
                                    any patches are available, go to:</p>

<p>If a patch has not been applied (patches are dated), open the Readme file to determine whether it
            is relevant to your environment. The Readme file also contains installation
            instructions.</p></conbody></concept>
